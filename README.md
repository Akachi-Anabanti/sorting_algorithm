# Sorting Algorithms Project

## Learning Objectives

1. **Understanding Sorting Algorithms**: Learn and implement at least four different sorting algorithms. This could include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.

2. **Big O Notation and Time Complexity**: Understand the concept of Big O notation and how it is used to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm. This will involve learning how to count the number of operations in an algorithm and express this count in terms of the size of the input.

3. **Choosing the Right Sorting Algorithm**: Learn how to select the most efficient sorting algorithm based on the characteristics of the input. This includes considering factors such as the size of the input, whether the input is partially sorted, and the importance of stability.

4. **Stable Sorting Algorithms**: Understand what a stable sorting algorithm is and why stability might be important for certain inputs.

## Project Description

In this project, you will implement several different sorting algorithms, evaluate their time complexities, and learn how to choose the best sorting algorithm for a given input. You will also explore the concept of stable sorting algorithms and understand when a stable sort is necessary.
